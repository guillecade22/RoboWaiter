## Description
Robowaiter is a small autonomous robot designed specifically for serving shots (drinks) in a bar setting. This innovative project aims to revolutionize the way drinks are served by leveraging robotics technology. With its compact size and intelligent navigation system, Robowaiter can maneuver through crowded bar spaces with ease, delivering shots efficiently and autonomously. Additionally, it is equipped with a camera for facial recognition and voice recognition capabilities, enhancing its interaction with customers.

## Install
To set up Robowaiter, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Refer to the README files within each component directory for detailed installation instructions.

## Library

### Hardware
The hardware library includes all the necessary components and designs for building Robowaiter's physical structure. It contains schematics, PCB designs, and assembly instructions to help you construct the robot.

### 3D
In the 3D library, you'll find printable designs for enclosures, mounts, and other physical structures required for Robowaiter. These designs are available in various formats compatible with most 3D printers.

### Software
The software library houses the codebase needed to operate Robowaiter effectively. It encompasses firmware for the robot's embedded systems, as well as any desktop applications or software components essential for seamless integration with the hardware.
